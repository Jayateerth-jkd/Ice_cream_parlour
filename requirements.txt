# List of dependencies for the Ice Cream Parlor application

# No external libraries are required for SQLite as it is part of Python's standard library.
# This file is included for future use if additional dependencies are needed.

# Example: If you plan to use an ORM like SQLAlchemy in the future, you can add it here.
# sqlalchemy>=2.0.0

# Example: If you plan to add a web interface using Flask, you can add it here.
# flask>=2.0.0

# For now, the file is empty because no external dependencies are required.
